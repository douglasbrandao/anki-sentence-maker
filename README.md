# Anki Sentence Maker

Anki Sentence Maker is a personal project in progress to help me a increase my vocabulary in english and it stemmed from a way that i like to use to import my sentences on Anki.

## How it is going to work

* User will give a list of words
* The script will look it up in a variety of dictionaries
* The script will create a .csv file with rows in the format below

## Row format

|Sentence|Information|
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|He played with the band at a recent gig.| gig /ɡɪɡ/ (a performance by musicians playing popular music or jazz in front of an audience; a similar performance by a comedian)|

> This way, we have the information about the word that we would like to learn as a short definition about it and its phonetic notation.

## Dictionaries under implementation

* Cambridge Dictionary
* Oxford Dictionary

## Need to be implemented

* Minimum of sentences
> Example: The user could want at least 3 sentences of a word, but sometimes in one dictionary we can't find this minimum of sentences, so we have to look it up in other dictionaries to attain this minimum.
* Put others dictionaries as Collins Dictionary, MacMillan, etc.

## To the future

* Different languages to look it up
* Create a easier interface to use
